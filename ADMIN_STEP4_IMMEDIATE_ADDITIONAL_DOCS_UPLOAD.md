# Admin Step 4 - Immediate Additional Documents Upload

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of immediate additional documents upload functionality for admin step 4. When an admin uploads additional documents in step 4, they are now immediately saved to both MySQL database (`step4_final_additional_doc` column) and file storage, providing instant persistence and availability.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### **Before (Previous Behavior)**
- Additional documents were stored temporarily in `pendingStep4Documents`
- Files were not uploaded to file storage immediately
- Database was not updated until a separate action
- Risk of data loss if admin navigated away before saving

### **After (New Behavior)**
- Additional documents are immediately uploaded to file storage
- Database is updated instantly with file metadata in `step4_final_additional_doc` column
- Local state is updated immediately
- Success/error feedback provided via toast notifications
- No risk of data loss

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Database Schema Update**

**New Column Added**:
- **Column Name**: `step4_final_additional_doc`
- **Data Type**: JSON
- **Purpose**: Stores step 4 additional documents as JSON array
- **Location**: `registrations` table

**Migration Script**: `scripts/check-step4-additional-doc-column.js`

### **2. Modified `handleAddDocumentSubmit` Function**

**File**: `components/admin/CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
- Added step detection logic to differentiate between step 3 and step 4
- For step 4: calls `handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload` for immediate save
- For step 3: uses existing `handleAdditionalDocumentUpload` for temporary storage

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
const handleAddDocumentSubmit = async () => {
  if (additionalDocumentTitle.trim() && additionalDocumentFile) {
    // Check if we're in step 4 (incorporation step)
    if (selectedCompany.currentStep === 'incorporate' || selectedCompany.status === 'incorporation-processing') {
      // For step 4, immediately save to file storage and database
      await handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload(selectedCompany._id, additionalDocumentTitle.trim(), additionalDocumentFile)
    } else {
      // For step 3, use the existing temporary storage approach
      handleAdditionalDocumentUpload(selectedCompany._id, additionalDocumentTitle.trim(), additionalDocumentFile)
    }
    setAdditionalDocumentTitle('')
    setAdditionalDocumentFile(null)
    setShowAddDocumentDialog(false)
  }
}
```

### **3. New `handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload` Function**

**File**: `components/admin/CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Immediately uploads file to file storage using `fileUploadClient.uploadFile()`
- Creates document object with complete file metadata
- Fetches current registration from database
- Updates `step4_final_additional_doc` column with new document
- Updates local state immediately
- Provides success/error toast notifications

**Code Structure**:
```javascript
const handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload = async (companyId: string, title: string, file: File) => {
  try {
    // 1. Upload file to file storage immediately
    const uploadResult = await fileUploadClient.uploadFile(file, companyId);
    
    // 2. Create document object with file storage data
    const document = {
      name: file.name,
      type: file.type,
      size: file.size,
      title: title,
      url: uploadResult.file.url,
      filePath: uploadResult.file.filePath,
      id: uploadResult.file.id,
      uploadedAt: uploadResult.file.uploadedAt,
    }
    
    // 3. Get current registration and add to existing documents
    const currentRegistration = await fetch(`/api/registrations/${companyId}`).then(r => r.json());
    const existingStep4Documents = currentRegistration.step4FinalAdditionalDoc || [];
    const updatedStep4Documents = [...existingStep4Documents, document];
    
    // 4. Update MySQL database immediately
    const updateResponse = await fetch(`/api/registrations/${companyId}`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        ...currentRegistration,
        step4FinalAdditionalDoc: updatedStep4Documents,
        updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      })
    });
    
    // 5. Update local state and show success message
    setSelectedCompany(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      step4FinalAdditionalDoc: updatedStep4Documents
    }));
    
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: "Additional document uploaded and saved successfully!",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling with toast notification
  }
}
```

### **4. Updated Step 4 UI Display**

**File**: `components/admin/CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Modified additional documents section to display from `selectedCompany.step4FinalAdditionalDoc`
- Updated conditional rendering to check for step 4 documents
- Maintains existing pending documents display for step 3

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
{(pendingStep4Documents.additionalDocuments && pendingStep4Documents.additionalDocuments.length > 0) || 
 (selectedCompany.step4FinalAdditionalDoc && selectedCompany.step4FinalAdditionalDoc.length > 0) ? (
  // Display documents
) : (
  // Show empty state
)}
```

### **5. API Endpoint Updates**

**File**: `app/api/registrations/[id]/route.ts`

**GET Method Changes**:
- Added `step4FinalAdditionalDoc` field to response
- Converts `step4_final_additional_doc` database column to camelCase

**PUT Method Changes**:
- Added `step4_final_additional_doc` to UPDATE query
- Added `body.step4FinalAdditionalDoc` parameter handling
- Supports JSON stringification for the field

## 📊 Data Flow

### **1. Admin Upload Process**
```
Admin Interface → Add Document Dialog → handleAddDocumentSubmit() → 
Step Detection → handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload() → 
File Storage → Database Update → Local State → Success Toast
```

### **2. File Storage Integration**
- Files uploaded to `/uploads/documents/` directory
- Unique file IDs generated for tracking
- File metadata stored in database as JSON array

### **3. Database Storage**
```sql
-- Step 4 additional documents stored as JSON array in step4_final_additional_doc column
[
  {
    "name": "business-plan.pdf",
    "type": "application/pdf",
    "size": 2048000,
    "title": "Business Plan",
    "url": "/uploads/documents/business-plan.pdf",
    "filePath": "documents/business-plan.pdf",
    "id": "step4-doc-1234567890",
    "uploadedAt": "2025-08-07T18:33:07.920Z"
  }
]
```

## 🧪 Testing
