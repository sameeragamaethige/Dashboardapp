# Step 4 Additional Documents Upload - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **Issue Analysis**

You reported that additional documents are being saved to file storage but not to the MySQL database in admin step 4. After comprehensive testing, I found that:

‚úÖ **Database functionality is working correctly**  
‚úÖ **API endpoints are working correctly**  
‚úÖ **Step detection is working correctly**  
‚úÖ **File storage is working correctly**  

## üö® **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is likely in the **frontend execution** rather than the backend. Here are the most probable causes:

### **1. Step Detection Issue**
- You might not be working with a company that's actually in step 4
- The step detection logic might not be triggering correctly

### **2. Browser Console Errors**
- JavaScript errors preventing the function from executing
- Network request failures
- CORS or other browser security issues

### **3. Function Call Issues**
- The `handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload` function might not be called
- The function might be called but failing silently

## üîß **Immediate Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify You're in Step 4**
1. **Check the company's current step** in the admin interface
2. **Look for these indicators**:
   - Current Step should be `"incorporate"`
   - Status should be `"incorporation-processing"` or `"completed"`
   - Documents Approved should be `1`

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Try to upload an additional document**
4. **Look for these debug messages**:
   ```
   üîç handleAddDocumentSubmit - Debug info:
     - Is Step 4? true
   üìÅ handleAddDocumentSubmit - Calling handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload for step 4
   üìÅ Admin - handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload called with:
   ‚úÖ File uploaded to storage successfully
   ‚úÖ Step 4 additional document saved to MySQL database successfully
   ```

### **Step 3: Check Network Tab**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Try to upload an additional document**
4. **Look for API calls**:
   - `GET /api/registrations/[companyId]` (should return 200)
   - `PUT /api/registrations/[companyId]` (should return 200)

## üß™ **Diagnostic Tests**

### **Test 1: Check Current Company Status**
Run this script to see what step your companies are in:
```bash
node scripts/check-step-detection.js
```

### **Test 2: Real-time Monitoring**
Run this script to monitor database changes in real-time:
```bash
node scripts/test-real-time-step4-upload.js
```
Then try uploading a document and watch the console.

### **Test 3: API Direct Test**
Run this script to test the API directly:
```bash
node scripts/test-api-step4-upload.js
```

## üéØ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Is Step 4? false"**
**Problem**: The company is not in step 4
**Solution**: 
- Check if the company's `current_step` is `"incorporate"`
- Check if the company's `status` is `"incorporation-processing"` or `"completed"`
- If not, the company needs to progress to step 4 first

### **Issue 2: No debug messages in console**
**Problem**: The function is not being called
**Solution**:
- Check for JavaScript errors in the console
- Ensure the server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check if there are any network errors

### **Issue 3: "File uploaded to storage successfully" but no database update**
**Problem**: The API call is failing
**Solution**:
- Check the Network tab for failed API calls
- Look for 500 errors or other HTTP errors
- Check if the server is running and accessible

### **Issue 4: "Failed to fetch registration from database"**
**Problem**: API connection issue
**Solution**:
- Ensure the server is running
- Check if the API endpoint is accessible
- Verify the company ID is correct

## üìã **Expected Behavior**

### **When Working Correctly:**
1. **File Selection**: Choose file and enter title
2. **Console Messages**: See debug messages confirming step 4 detection
3. **File Upload**: File uploads to storage (console shows success)
4. **Database Update**: API call updates database (console shows success)
5. **UI Update**: Document appears in the list immediately
6. **Success Message**: Toast notification confirms success

### **Console Output Should Show:**
```
üîç handleAddDocumentSubmit - Debug info:
  - selectedCompany._id: reg_1234567890_abc123
  - selectedCompany.currentStep: incorporate
  - selectedCompany.status: incorporation-processing
  - additionalDocumentTitle: My Document
  - additionalDocumentFile.name: document.pdf
  - Is Step 4? true
üìÅ handleAddDocumentSubmit - Calling handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload for step 4
üìÅ Admin - handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload called with:
  - companyId: reg_1234567890_abc123
  - title: My Document
  - file.name: document.pdf
‚úÖ File uploaded to storage successfully: document.pdf
‚úÖ Step 4 additional document saved to MySQL database successfully
‚úÖ handleStep4AdditionalDocumentUpload completed successfully
```

## üîß **Manual Verification Steps**

### **Step 1: Database Check**
```sql
SELECT id, company_name, current_step, status, step4_final_additional_doc 
FROM registrations 
WHERE current_step = 'incorporate' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Step 2: API Check**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/registrations/[companyId]
```

### **Step 3: Direct Database Update Test**
```sql
UPDATE registrations 
SET step4_final_additional_doc = JSON_ARRAY(
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'name', 'test.pdf',
    'type', 'application/pdf',
    'size', 1024000,
    'title', 'Test Document',
    'url', '/uploads/documents/test.pdf',
    'filePath', 'documents/test.pdf',
    'id', 'test-123',
    'uploadedAt', NOW()
  )
)
WHERE id = '[companyId]';
```

## üö® **Emergency Fix**

If you need to manually add a document to the database:

1. **Get the company ID** from the admin interface
2. **Run the database check** to see current documents
3. **Use the direct database update** to add the document
4. **Refresh the admin interface** to see the changes

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Run the diagnostic tests** above
2. **Check the browser console** for debug messages
3. **Verify you're working with a step 4 company**
4. **Check for any JavaScript errors**
5. **Ensure the server is running**

If the issue persists after following these steps, please provide:
- The browser console output
- The company ID you're working with
- Any error messages you see
- The results of the diagnostic tests

## ‚úÖ **Verification**

The implementation is **working correctly** based on all tests. The issue is likely environmental or related to the specific company/step you're working with. Follow the troubleshooting steps above to identify the exact cause.
