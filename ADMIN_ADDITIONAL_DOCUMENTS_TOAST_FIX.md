# Admin Additional Documents Toast Fix

## Problem Description
When admin uploaded additional documents, the system was showing browser alert messages (`alert()`) which provided a poor user experience. These browser alerts are intrusive and don't match the modern UI design of the application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Browser Alerts**: Multiple `alert()` calls throughout the admin document management functions
2. **Poor UX**: Intrusive browser popups that block user interaction
3. **Inconsistent UI**: Alerts don't match the application's design system
4. **No Styling**: Browser alerts cannot be styled or customized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Toast Notification System

**Imports Added:**
```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"
```

**Toast Hook Added:**
```typescript
const { toast } = useToast()
```

**Toaster Component Added to Layout:**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster"

// In the body
<Toaster />
```

### 2. Replaced All Browser Alerts with Toast Notifications

#### Before (Browser Alerts):
```javascript
alert('Failed to fetch registration data. Please try again.');
alert('Failed to upload file. Please try again.');
alert('Failed to save document to database. Please try again.');
alert('Document uploaded and saved successfully!');
alert('Error adding document. Please try again.');
alert('Failed to publish documents. Please try again.');
alert('Error publishing documents. Please try again.');
alert('Error submitting documents. Please try again.');
alert('Error completing registration. Please try again.');
```

#### After (Toast Notifications):
```javascript
// Error toasts
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "Failed to fetch registration data. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});

// Success toasts
toast({
  title: "Success",
  description: "Document uploaded and saved successfully!",
});
```

### 3. Toast Notification Types

**Error Notifications:**
- Used `variant: "destructive"` for error messages
- Red styling to indicate errors
- Clear error descriptions

**Success Notifications:**
- Used default variant for success messages
- Green styling to indicate success
- Positive feedback for user actions

## Functions Updated

### 1. `handleAddNewDocument`
- **Before**: 5 alert calls for various error conditions
- **After**: 5 toast notifications with proper styling
- **Benefits**: Better error handling and user feedback

### 2. `publishDocumentsToCustomer`
- **Before**: 2 alert calls for publish errors
- **After**: 2 toast notifications with error styling
- **Benefits**: Non-intrusive error feedback

### 3. `handleSubmitDocuments`
- **Before**: 1 alert call for submission errors
- **After**: 1 toast notification with error styling
- **Benefits**: Smooth error handling

### 4. `handleCompleteRegistration`
- **Before**: 1 alert call for completion errors
- **After**: 1 toast notification with error styling
- **Benefits**: Better completion feedback

3. **Professional Appearance**: Modern notification system instead of browser alerts
4. **Improved Accessibility**: Better support for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Toast Hook Usage

  description: "Operation completed successfully!",
});

// Error notification
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "Something went wrong. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

### Layout Integration
The `Toaster` component is added to the root layout to ensure toast notifications are available throughout the application.

## Files Modified

1. **`components/admin/CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`**
   - Added `useToast` import
   - Added `toast` hook to component
   - Replaced all `alert()` calls with `toast()` calls

2. **`app/layout.tsx`**
   - Added `Toaster` import
   - Added `<Toaster />` component to layout

## Testing

The toast notification system can be tested by:
1. Uploading additional documents as admin
2. Triggering various error conditions
3. Verifying that toast notifications appear instead of browser alerts
4. Checking that notifications are properly styled and dismissible

## Usage

Now when admin performs actions with additional documents:
1. **Success**: Green toast notification appears with success message
2. **Error**: Red toast notification appears with error message
3. **No Browser Alerts**: No more intrusive browser popups
4. **Better UX**: Smooth, professional notification system

The admin additional documents section now provides a modern, user-friendly notification system that enhances the overall user experience.
