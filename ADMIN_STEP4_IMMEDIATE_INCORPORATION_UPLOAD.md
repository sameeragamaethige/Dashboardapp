# Admin Step 4 - Immediate Incorporation Certificate Upload

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of immediate incorporation certificate upload functionality for admin step 4. When an admin uploads an incorporation certificate, it is now immediately saved to both MySQL database and file storage, providing instant persistence and availability.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### **Before (Previous Behavior)**
- Incorporation certificates were stored temporarily in `pendingStep4Documents`
- Files were not uploaded to file storage immediately
- Database was not updated until a separate "Submit Documents" action
- Risk of data loss if admin navigated away before submitting

### **After (New Behavior)**
- Incorporation certificates are immediately uploaded to file storage
- Database is updated instantly with file metadata
- Local state is updated immediately
- Success/error feedback provided via toast notifications
- No risk of data loss

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Modified `handleDocumentUpload` Function**

**File**: `components/admin/CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
- Removed special handling for `incorporationCertificate` that stored files temporarily
- Now treats incorporation certificates like step 3 documents with immediate upload
- Added file storage upload using `fileUploadClient.uploadFile()`
- Added immediate database update via API call
- Added success/error toast notifications

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Special handling for incorporation certificate
if (documentType === "incorporationCertificate") {
  // Store temporarily without saving
  setPendingStep4Documents((prev: any) => ({
    ...prev,
    incorporationCertificate: document
  }))
  return
}

// After: Immediate upload for all documents including incorporation certificate
console.log(`📁 Admin - Immediately uploading document: ${documentType}, file: ${file.name}`);

// Upload file to file storage immediately
const uploadResult = await fileUploadClient.uploadFile(file, companyId);

// Create document object with file storage data
const document = {
  name: file.name,
  type: file.type,
  size: file.size,
  url: uploadResult.file.url,
  filePath: uploadResult.file.filePath,
  id: uploadResult.file.id,
  uploadedAt: uploadResult.file.uploadedAt,
}

// Update local state immediately
setSelectedCompany((prev: any) => {
  const updated = { ...prev }
  updated[documentType] = document
  return updated
})

// Save to MySQL database immediately
const response = await fetch(`/api/registrations/${companyId}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(updateData)
});
```

### **2. Added User Feedback**

**Success Toast**:
```javascript
toast({
  title: "Success",
  description: `${documentType === "incorporationCertificate" ? "Incorporation certificate" : "Document"} uploaded and saved successfully!`,
});
```

**Error Toast**:
```javascript
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: `Failed to upload ${documentType === "incorporationCertificate" ? "incorporation certificate" : "document"}. Please try again.`,
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

### **3. Cleanup of Pending Documents**

When incorporation certificate is uploaded, any pending documents are cleared:
```javascript
if (documentType === "incorporationCertificate") {
  setPendingStep4Documents((prev: any) => ({
    ...prev,
    incorporationCertificate: null
  }))
}
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### **1. Admin Upload Process**
```
Admin Interface → File Selection → handleDocumentUpload() → File Storage → Database → Local State → Success Toast
```

### **2. File Storage Integration**
- Files uploaded to `/uploads/documents/` directory
- Unique file IDs generated for tracking
- File metadata stored in database as JSON

### **3. Database Storage**
```sql
-- Incorporation certificate stored as JSON in incorporation_certificate column
{
  "name": "incorporation_certificate.pdf",
  "type": "application/pdf", 
  "size": 1024000,
  "url": "/uploads/documents/incorporation_certificate.pdf",
  "filePath": "documents/incorporation_certificate.pdf",
  "id": "inc-cert-1234567890",
  "uploadedAt": "2025-08-07T18:24:25.043Z"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Script Created**
- **File**: `scripts/test-admin-step4-incorporation-upload.js`
- **Purpose**: Verifies database functionality and API integration
- **Results**: ✅ All tests passing

### **Test Results**
```
✅ Connected to database successfully
✅ Incorporation certificate saved to database successfully
✅ All required incorporation certificate fields are present
✅ Incorporation certificate upload simulation successful
✅ Database update working correctly
✅ API call successful
✅ Incorporation certificate found in API response
```
