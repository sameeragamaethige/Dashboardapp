# Admin Step3 Document Management with MySQL Integration

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced admin step3 document management functionality that saves documents instantly to MySQL database and file storage when admin uploads them, and ensures the "Publish to Customer" button works correctly.

## Key Features

### ✅ Instant MySQL Integration
- **Immediate Database Save**: When admin uploads step3 additional documents, they are instantly saved to MySQL database
- **File Storage Integration**: Files are uploaded to file storage and URLs are stored in database
- **Real-time Updates**: Database is updated immediately, not just on "Publish to Customer"

### ✅ Enhanced Document Management
- **Add Documents**: Admin can add new step3 additional documents with custom titles
- **Remove Documents**: Admin can remove existing step3 additional documents
- **Replace Documents**: Admin can replace existing documents with new files
- **Instant Persistence**: All changes are saved to MySQL immediately

### ✅ Publish to Customer Functionality
- **Status Management**: Sets `documents_published = true` and `status = 'documents-published'`
- **Customer Access**: Customer can access step3 documents when published
- **Complete Workflow**: Handles all document types (form1, letterOfEngagement, aoa, form18, step3 additional)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses the following MySQL columns for step3 document management:

```sql
-- Admin uploaded step3 additional documents (JSON array)
step3_additional_doc JSON

-- Customer signed step3 additional documents (JSON object)
step3_signed_additional_doc JSON

-- Publishing status
documents_published BOOLEAN
documents_published_at TIMESTAMP
status VARCHAR(50)
```

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/registrations/[id]`
- Returns registration data including `step3AdditionalDoc` field
- Converts snake_case database fields to camelCase for frontend

#### PUT `/api/registrations/[id]`
- Updates registration data including step3 documents
- Handles JSON serialization of document arrays

#### PUT `/api/registrations/[id]/customer-documents`
- Updates customer signed documents including `step3SignedAdditionalDoc`

### Frontend Components

#### Admin Component: `CompanyDetailsPage.tsx`

**Key Functions:**

1. **`handleAdditionalDocumentUpload()`**
   - Stores documents temporarily in state
   - Called when admin selects files

2. **`saveStep3DocumentsToDatabase()`**
   - Uploads files to file storage
   - Saves document metadata to MySQL database
   - Updates local state

3. **`handleAddNewDocument()`**
   - Adds new step3 additional document
   - Calls `saveStep3DocumentsToDatabase()` immediately

4. **`handleRemoveAdditionalDocument()`**
   - Removes documents from MySQL database
   - Updates local state

5. **`handleReplaceAdditionalDocument()`**
   - Replaces existing documents in MySQL database
   - Uploads new files to file storage

6. **`publishDocumentsToCustomer()`**
   - Processes all pending documents
   - Sets publishing status in MySQL
   - Enables customer access

**UI Elements:**
- Document upload cards for each step3 additional document
- Add document dialog with title and file input
- Remove/replace buttons for existing documents
- "Publish to Customer" button

#### Customer Component: `DocumentationStep.tsx`

**Key Features:**
- Displays step3 additional documents in download tab
- Provides upload interface for signed versions
- Saves signed documents to `step3SignedAdditionalDoc` column

## Data Flow

### Admin Upload Flow
```
1. Admin selects file → handleAdditionalDocumentUpload()
2. File stored temporarily → pendingStep3Documents state
3. Admin clicks "Add Document" → handleAddNewDocument()
4. File uploaded to storage → fileUploadClient.uploadFile()
5. Document saved to MySQL → PUT /api/registrations/[id]
6. Local state updated → setSelectedCompany()
```

### Publish to Customer Flow
```
1. Admin clicks "Publish to Customer" → publishDocumentsToCustomer()
2. All pending documents processed → fileUploadClient.uploadFile()
3. Database updated with all documents → PUT /api/registrations/[id]
4. Publishing status set → documents_published = true
5. Customer can now access documents
```

### Customer Access Flow
```
1. Customer loads step3 → DocumentationStep component
2. API fetches registration → GET /api/registrations/[id]
3. step3AdditionalDoc displayed → Download tab
4. Customer uploads signed versions → PUT /api/registrations/[id]/customer-documents
5. Signed documents saved → step3SignedAdditionalDoc column
```

## Document Structure

### Admin Uploads (step3_additional_doc)
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Business Plan Template",
    "name": "business-plan-template.pdf",
    "type": "application/pdf",
    "size": 2048000,
    "url": "/uploads/documents/business-plan-template.pdf",
    "filePath": "documents/business-plan-template.pdf",
    "id": "admin-doc-001",
    "uploadedAt": "2025-08-05T22:53:24.933Z"
  }
]
```

### Customer Uploads (step3_signed_additional_doc)
```json
{
  "Business Plan Template": {
    "name": "signed-business-plan.pdf",
    "type": "application/pdf",
    "size": 2150400,
    "url": "/uploads/documents/signed-business-plan.pdf",
    "filePath": "documents/signed-business-plan.pdf",
    "id": "signed-doc-001",
    "title": "Business Plan Template",
    "uploadedAt": "2025-08-05T22:53:24.933Z",
    "signedByCustomer": true,
    "submittedAt": "2025-08-05T22:53:24.933Z"
  }
}
```

- Error rate tracking
- User activity monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Documents not saving to database**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify API endpoint availability
   - Check for validation errors

2. **Files not uploading to storage**

   - Verify upload directory exists
   - Check file size limits

3. **Customer cannot access documents**
   - Verify `documents_published` is true
   - Check `status` is 'documents-published'
   - Verify file URLs are accessible

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check database connection
npm run test-mysql

# Test file storage
npm run test-files

# Test admin step3 functionality
npm run test-admin-step3-mysql
```
