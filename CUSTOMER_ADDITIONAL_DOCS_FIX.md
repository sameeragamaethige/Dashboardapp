# Customer Additional Documents Fix

## 🐛 Issue Description

When a customer uploaded signed additional documents in step3, only one document was being saved to MySQL and filestorage. The problem was that when uploading a new additional document, the system was overwriting the previously uploaded documents instead of preserving them.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `saveCustomerDocumentToDatabase` function in `components/customer/registration-steps/DocumentationStep.tsx`. When handling step3 additional documents, the function was only saving the current document being uploaded and not preserving the previously uploaded documents.

### Problem Code (Before Fix):
```javascript
} else if (documentType.startsWith('step3_additional_')) {
  // Handle step 3 additional documents
  const step3AdditionalIndex = parseInt(documentType.split('_')[2])
  const step3AdditionalDocuments = companyData.step3AdditionalDoc || []
  const originalDoc = step3AdditionalDocuments[step3AdditionalIndex]

  if (originalDoc) {
    // Add the signed step 3 additional document to customerDocuments
    customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc = customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc || {}
    customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc[originalDoc.title] = document
  }
}
```

**Problem**: This code only saved the current document and overwrote any previously saved documents.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code (After Fix):
```javascript
} else if (documentType.startsWith('step3_additional_')) {
  // Handle step 3 additional documents
  const step3AdditionalIndex = parseInt(documentType.split('_')[2])
  const step3AdditionalDocuments = companyData.step3AdditionalDoc || []
  const originalDoc = step3AdditionalDocuments[step3AdditionalIndex]

  if (originalDoc) {
    // Initialize step3SignedAdditionalDoc if it doesn't exist
    customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc = customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc || {}
    
    // Add the current signed step 3 additional document
    customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc[originalDoc.title] = document
    
    // Include ALL previously uploaded step 3 additional documents
    if (companyData.step3AdditionalDoc && companyData.step3AdditionalDoc.length > 0) {
      companyData.step3AdditionalDoc.forEach((doc: any, index: number) => {
        const signedDoc = currentSignedDocuments[`step3_additional_${index}`]
        if (signedDoc && typeof signedDoc === 'object' && index !== step3AdditionalIndex) {
          customerDocuments.step3SignedAdditionalDoc[doc.title] = signedDoc
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution**: The fix now:
1. Saves the current document being uploaded
2. Iterates through all step3 additional documents
3. Includes all previously uploaded signed documents (excluding the current one to avoid duplication)
4. Preserves all existing documents when uploading new ones

## 🔧 Similar Fix for Regular Additional Documents

The same issue existed for regular additional documents. Applied the same fix:

### Before Fix:
```javascript
if (documentType.startsWith('additional_')) {
  const additionalIndex = parseInt(documentType.split('_')[1])
  const additionalDocuments = companyData.additionalDocuments || []
  const originalDoc = additionalDocuments[additionalIndex]

  if (originalDoc) {
    // Add the signed additional document to customerDocuments
    customerDocuments.additionalDocuments = customerDocuments.additionalDocuments || {}
    customerDocuments.additionalDocuments[originalDoc.title] = document
  }
}
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
if (documentType.startsWith('additional_')) {
  const additionalIndex = parseInt(documentType.split('_')[1])
  const additionalDocuments = companyData.additionalDocuments || []
  const originalDoc = additionalDocuments[additionalIndex]

  if (originalDoc) {
    // Initialize additionalDocuments if it doesn't exist
    customerDocuments.additionalDocuments = customerDocuments.additionalDocuments || {}
    
    // Add the current signed additional document
    customerDocuments.additionalDocuments[originalDoc.title] = document
    
    // Include ALL previously uploaded additional documents
    if (companyData.additionalDocuments && companyData.additionalDocuments.length > 0) {
      companyData.additionalDocuments.forEach((doc: any, index: number) => {
        const signedDoc = currentSignedDocuments[`additional_${index}`]
        if (signedDoc && typeof signedDoc === 'object' && index !== additionalIndex) {
          customerDocuments.additionalDocuments[doc.title] = signedDoc
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Verification

Created comprehensive test script `scripts/test-customer-additional-docs-save.js` to verify the fix:

### Test Results:
```
🎯 Overall Result: 6/6 tests passed
✅ Create Test Registration
✅ Upload First Document
✅ Upload Second Document
✅ Upload Third Document
✅ File Storage Integration
✅ Database Integrity
```

### Test Coverage:
1. **First Document Upload**: Verifies single document is saved correctly
2. **Second Document Upload**: Verifies both documents are preserved
3. **Third Document Upload**: Verifies all three documents are preserved
4. **File Storage**: Verifies files are saved to disk
5. **Database Integrity**: Verifies data structure and required fields

## 📋 Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `components/customer/registration-steps/DocumentationStep.tsx`

### Functions Updated:
- `saveCustomerDocumentToDatabase()` - Fixed document preservation logic

### Test Scripts Added:
- `scripts/test-customer-additional-docs-save.js` - Comprehensive testing
- Added to `package.json` as `test-customer-additional-docs`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
- Upload Document 1 → Only Document 1 saved
- Upload Document 2 → Only Document 2 saved (Document 1 lost)
- Upload Document 3 → Only Document 3 saved (Documents 1 & 2 lost)

### After Fix:
- Upload Document 1 → Document 1 saved
- Upload Document 2 → Documents 1 & 2 saved
- Upload Document 3 → Documents 1, 2 & 3 saved

## 🔄 Data Flow After Fix

1. **Customer Uploads Document**: File uploaded to filestore immediately
2. **Document Processing**: Current document added to customerDocuments object
3. **Previous Documents Preservation**: All previously uploaded documents retrieved from state
4. **Database Save**: Complete customerDocuments object saved to MySQL
5. **State Update**: Local state updated for UI feedback

## ✅ Verification Commands

### Run the Fix Test:
```bash
npm run test-customer-additional-docs
```

### Run Existing Tests (Ensure No Regression):
```bash
npm run test-admin-customer-display
npm run test-admin-step3-management
```

## 🎉 Final Status

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

The issue has been completely resolved. All customer uploaded additional documents are now saved immediately to both MySQL database and filestorage, with proper preservation of previously uploaded documents.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ All additional documents preserved when uploading new ones
- ✅ Immediate save to MySQL and filestorage
- ✅ No data loss during upload process
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality
